# Airbnb-MachineLearningLabs

These machine learning labs and minilab are a 15 week exploration of an Airbnb New York City dataset from Kaggle. Authored by Thomas Karba with additional team members Jordan Salsman, Muchigi Kimari, and Angelo Bravo of Souther Methodist University. Under direction of professor and researcher Jake Drew we apply a number of different objectives in each lab; the details can be read in each notebook. We explore the data, apply different algorithms for classification, regression, and clustering to solve different problems presented by the data. The problem which Thomas Karba directed was generally about classifying listing properties as hotel quality or not, using many features and even creating new features to help solve it.
